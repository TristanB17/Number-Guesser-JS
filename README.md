# Number-Guesser-JS
A number guessing game made using vanilla JavaScript

In this game, users will guess a number between one and one hundred. The game will not allow non-numbers to be entered,
and will inform the user if their guess is too high, too low, or out of range. In addition, upon winning the game, users will
find that the range is automatically increased by 20 (the minimum is lowered by ten, and the maximum is heightened by ten).

Users also have the option of setting a range themselves, which the game will use as parameters 
for generating a random number.
